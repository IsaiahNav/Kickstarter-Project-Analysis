# Kickstarter-Project-Analysis
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects

This research is dedicated to unraveling the mystery of Kickstarter project success, with a primary focus on discerning the pivotal factors that contribute to project triumph. The dataset comprises essential variables such as project category, currency, deadline, launch timing, funding goal in native currency, pledged amounts in native currency, project state (success or failure), backer count, project location, USD pledged, and the actual USD goal.

Central to our investigation is the project 'state' variable, serving as the label for our predictive analysis. Our primary goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately anticipates the success or failure of Kickstarter projects. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to identify the underlying patterns and dependencies among the provided variables that significantly impact project outcomes.

The findings of this study hold significant implications for project creators, backers, and the crowdfunding community, offering actionable insights into the recipe for Kickstarter success. A successful predictive model can empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize project planning, and enhance the overall effectiveness of crowdfunding initiatives, fostering a more resilient and prosperous crowdfunding landscape.
